    <p class="text-example"> The IPCC's Sixth Assessment report, published in 2021, 
        found that human emissions of heat-trapping gases have already warmed the 
        climate by nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius) since 1850-1900. </p>
    
    <div class="div-example"> As the climate heats up, rainfall patterns change, 
        evaporation increases, glaciers melt and sea levels rise. All these factors 
        affect the availability of fresh water. More frequent and severe droughts and rising water 
        temperatures are expected to cause a decrease in water quality.</div>
